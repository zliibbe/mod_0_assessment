/*I took a break to be with my daughter and put her to bed (as my spouse
left town today to care for my brother and sister-in-law) inbetween
Part 1: Quiz and Part 2: work. I finished the quiz in less
than 10 minutes and worked on part 2 for about 45 mins. Just want to
be clear, that although my time was divided I adhered to the time
requirements. I did not realize these should ideally be done together
until after I started the quiz. My apologies if I misunderstood the
timing. However, I was faithful to doing the work within the required
time, although the time block was divided. Thanks, Zach*/
